For the Mindsumo project through Capital One, I created, FastNews, a web application that is user-friendly and provides news pertaining to Sports, Entertainment, and Technology (it even has a section of General News on the Home Page!). Accompanied with twitter posts pertaining to that specific topic, each separate page hosts several articles derived from the NewsAPI that were all placed into a seperate array and filtered through to provide images (with all same sizes), links to the article (that opens in a separate tab), and a description of the article. In order to accompany for some errors that would occur, I also implemented a system that would detect if the image object in the array was "null" which in return simply not place an image on the web application as opposed to presenting the error image icon. Not only is FastNews  a very user-friendly application, it is also intricately designed with beautiful asthetics from the color of the background to the buttons and logo. Attached are a few screenshots of the web application, FastNews:
